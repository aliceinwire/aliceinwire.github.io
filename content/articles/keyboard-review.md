This was a test post but I think it can became a real post.  
The test site post was this:  
"Following is a review of my favorite mechanical keyboard."  
  
I actually recently bought a new keyboard.  
Usually I use a Happy Hacking Keyboard professional 2
english layout, I have two of them.

I really like my HHKB and I have no drow back on using it.  
Both keyboard are modded with the [hasu TMK controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=cukcsao4j1m6lu90h7svqjeui58hqaqj&topic=71517.0).  
The firmware is formatted with a colemak layout.  
  
But recently I see the advertisment of the ulitmate hacking   
keyboard.  
Is interesting that is made by a crowd founding and that looks  
heavily customizable.  
Was looking pretty solid, so I bought one.  
Here it is:

Having the key mark on the key, as a colemak user, was  
enough useless.  
But I had no problem remapping the firmware for following   
the colemak layout.
